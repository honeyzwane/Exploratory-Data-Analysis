# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
For this task, I have created a script for EDA. this script can be imported anywhere and used to go through a basic exploration of data. 
This EDA script shows if there are any missing values and their position. checks for outliers in numerical data, displays the data types from each column, checks value count for specific charecters, shows the datas correlation and lastly display a barchart of the data's skewness. I hope this makes someon's job a little simpler out there.
