# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
For this task, I have created a script for EDA. this script can be imported anywhere and used to go through a basic exploration of data. 
This EDA script shows if there are any missing values and their position. checks for outliers in numerical data, displays the data types from each column, checks for duplicates and shows the datas correlation. I hope this makes someone's job a little simpler out there.
